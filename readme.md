# Data Science Project | Jan 2024 - Mar 2024

## Overview
This repository showcases implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms and their evaluation using Python and NumPy. Detailed Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`) are provided with mathematical explanations and theory behind each algorithm.

## Implemented Models and Achievements

### K-Means Clustering from Scratch (Python, NumPy)
- **Objective:** Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python using NumPy.
- **Achievement:** Achieved a clustering accuracy of 71%.
- **Visualization:** Integrated Matplotlib for visualizing the clustering process.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated the clustering model using silhouette score for cluster quality assessment.

### Binary Logistic Regression from Scratch (Python)
- **Objective:** Developed a binary logistic regression model from scratch in Python.
- **Achievement:** Achieved an F1-score of 0.866 through precise hyperparameter tuning.
- **Comparison:** Compared the custom implementation with Scikit-Learn's logistic regression to validate results.
- **Visualization:** Visualized model performance metrics and decision boundaries using Matplotlib.

## Jupyter Notebooks
- Detailed Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`) are provided for each implemented model.
- Notebooks include:
  - Mathematical derivations and explanations of algorithms.
  - Step-by-step implementation in Python.
  - Evaluation metrics and performance analysis.

## Usage
- Each Jupyter Notebook can be opened using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Ensure all necessary Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.) are installed in your environment.

## Results and Evaluation
- Comprehensive evaluation of both models is presented, including accuracy, F1-score, and comparison with Scikit-Learn implementations.
- Detailed visualizations aid in understanding model behavior and performance.
